I mixed up which was which. This set produces an erroneous result
I implemented DFS with a stack (LIFO) and it worked.
Then i copied the DFS into BFS files and started modifing it to 
use a circular queue instead of a stack and it produces a result.

Unfortunately, I modified the DFSMazeRunner to use the queue (LIFO) 
instead of the BFSMazeRunner.

So here are copies of the files that produce results before I edit 
to try to swap the queue and the stac respectively.
